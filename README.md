# FermentControl
An ESP8266 based temperature controller mainly build for fermenting beer at constant temperatures.
Beside a small TFT display it has nodirect user controls. Instead, it gets configured by any kind of Home automation software (FHEM in my case) using Json Http requests to get/set data.
